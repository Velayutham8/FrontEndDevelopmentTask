I Ensure that i was followed this points,

* Do not use any library, while creating it from scratch 
* Design three interactive boxes â€“ one at the top, another in the middle, and the third at the bottom. Ensure these boxes dynamically expand upon clicking.

Coding Details:

Pixel Perfect Implementation: The webpage you create should match the design in Figma as closely as possible.

HTML: Use semantic HTML tags. We're interested in seeing how well you structure your HTML and whether you follow best practices.

CSS: Do not use any CSS frameworks or libraries. Write your own CSS code to style the webpage. Your ability to create responsive designs, handle various screen sizes, and use efficient and clean CSS will be under scrutiny.

JavaScript: If there are any interactive elements in the design, use vanilla JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks) to make them functional.

Code Cleanliness and Structuring: Your code should be well-structured, commented where necessary, and easy to read. Avoid redundancy.
